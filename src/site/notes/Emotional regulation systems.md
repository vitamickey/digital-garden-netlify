- Threat
    - Responses to perceived threats
    - Can be overly active
        - Enter: anxiety lol
    - Lots of neg emotions: anger, fear, disgust, sadness
- Drive
    - We spend a lot of time here
    - Taking action, heading towards goals
    - Hustle mode
- Soothe
    - Safety, comfort, ease, warmth, affection, care
    - Moderates the other two if they're running wild
    - IMPORTANT
    - We neglect this
    - Need to make a [[Self-soothing toolkit\|Self-soothing toolkit]], which I've been mearning to do for YONKS
