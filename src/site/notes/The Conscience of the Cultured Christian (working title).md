Engaging with culture is essential to understanding the world we live in, with great ramifications for thoughtfully communicating the Gospel and knowing how to best gird up our hearts in an ever-changing social and political landscape.

However, protecting our hearts in the first place is just as important as knowing enough to know what to avoid. Does that make sense?

I would not know the ways some things affect me and my heart negatively unless I had engaged with them first. There are other things that do not affect my conscience as much that I know others would be unable to engage in.

Matters of conscience are very difficult. If we engage in things, it can give permission to others who may otherwise need to avoid the same thing for the sake of their conscience. But also, when we engage with certain parts of culture, we have a unique opportunity to connect with people, in particular non-Christians, on matters of humanity and faith. What wins out?

This is an incomplete thought.
