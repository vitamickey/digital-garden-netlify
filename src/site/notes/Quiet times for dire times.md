I am in turmoil. 

> Pray first, not just because I am about to study but because I am distracted so I pray not to be. Read a psalm, so hopefully it turns my thoughts to God, or focus on some thing that God has recently done or revealed to me. Anything really that causes me to dwell on Him and nothing else - [[Charlie Harrison\|pastor]], [[dailyish/2022/08/2022-08-08\|2022-08-08]]

> what I was trying to say before messenger wigged out on me was that if I'm distracted it usually means theres something else on my mind that's probably worth talking to Him about - [[Joah\|friend]], [[dailyish/2022/08/2022-08-08\|2022-08-08]]
