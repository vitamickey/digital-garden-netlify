As in, a recorded history, as opposed to [[How to read the Bible\|strategies and methods]], or [[How I read the Bible\|the present tense]].

I mean, it is true that I've strived to [[Read the Bible every single day\|Read the Bible every single day]], even if it's just reading a single verse, or listening to a Psalm in a guided prayer.

And I find that if I don't [[Read the Bible in the morning (probably)\|Read the Bible in the morning (probably)]] then I forget it the next day.
