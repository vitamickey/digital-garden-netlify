This was just an interesting verse from my bible reading today. 

> To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. ([1 Corinthians 7:8–9](https://esv.org/1Corinthians7:8–9))

Going through 1 Corinthians myself for the first time has been a very interesting journey. Onwards we go.
