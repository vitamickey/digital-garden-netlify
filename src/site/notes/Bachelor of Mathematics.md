## I graduated

That's it. I finished at the end of 2024 and I am glad. I did a major of [[Statistics\|Statistics]].

It was actually super hard. Lots of struggles. A countably finite set of struggles. Well, actually, is hard to strictly define what a struggle was.

Graduating will probably go down in my personal history as the most simultaneously freeing/relieving moment of my life, whilst at the same time being incredibly underwhelming. I think, because of my strong attachment to [[High School\|high school]], finishing [[University\|uni]] had much less gravitas. Being in your teens is naturally more dramatic - graduating from Yr 12 was emotionally satisfying.

### What I studied

My major was [[Statistics\|Statistics]], so that is the main branch of [[Mathematics\|Mathematics]] I am comfortable with, but I spent a lot of my electives taking [[Linguistics\|Linguistics]] courses, because that is secretly my academic-related passion, and what I wish to pursue further. 

The branches of [[Mathematics\|Mathematics]] I am least comfortable with is basically anything above like first-year Calculus, particularly in physics-related applications.

I also dabbled in [[Computer Science\|Computer Science]] and [[Coding\|Coding]] and [[Computational Science\|Computational Science]].
