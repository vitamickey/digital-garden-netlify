## I graduated

That's it. I finished at the end of 2024 and I am glad. I did a major of [[Statistics\|Statistics]].

## 2023

If I don't finish all three of the 2022 Sem 2 courses, I need to complete 6 courses in 2023. Otherwise, I only need to complete 5 courses. I think I have more than enough level 1 course and electives to do all the linguistics course that would potentially fit into the rest of my degree.

### Semester 2

#### Need

- [ ] STAT3500 Problems & Applications in Modern Statistics
- [ ] [[STAT3006 Statistical Learning\|STAT3006 Statistical Learning]]

#### Potentially

- [ ] LING2045 Syntax
	- Ideal for potential MA of Linguistics
- [ ] MATH2504 Programming of Simulation, Analysis, and Learning Systems
