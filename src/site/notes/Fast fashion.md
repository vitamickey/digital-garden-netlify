The bleh part of [[Ethical fashion\|Ethical fashion]], and generally something I try not to engage in (as much as it can be helped).

##  My one recent purchase

At the end of last year (which, at the time of writing, was 2023), I bought this black dress from Cotton On. I tried it on at my uni's op shop and really liked it. I tried it on over my wide leg Everlane cargo pants and the silhouette was simply magnificent. I couldn't get it out of my mind for like two months. So, my boyfriend and I went to Cotton On, because I wanted to try take photos of it to draft a sewing pattern, or get an idea of the construction.

My boyfriend offered to just buy it for me. After having a small moral panic in the store (the implications of buying fast fashion are too much for my brain to comprehend), I let go of the guilt of buying something I knew I'd love for a while and wear until I ran it into the ground. The impact of me caving and buying one dress will not end the environment, and does not mean I do not care about the ethics of my clothing habits.

I now where this dress all the time. Like, maybe too much. My [[Angela Chua\|housemate]] called it "modern modest". I think that's true.

### What I learnt

Prioritise finding clothes you will love and use for a long time. Make fewer, more thoughtful purchases. I already knew this in part, but this helps me let go of the guilt of buying something first-hand if I know I will wear it a lot.

Additionally, I have learnt that it's not necessarily the length of dress that I dislike, but in general tighter silhouettes. This is a mini dress, which I thought I categorically disliked, but turns out I actually just don't like the feeling of my body contours being shown that much? It depends on the scenario.

## The effect of boycotting fast fashion on garment workers

### Thoughts

There is a big debate about what would happen to all the garment workers who earn their living off of fast fashion if we boycotted fast fashion companies. Would they be driven into worse industries riddled with exploitation, such as sex-related trades?
