## Meadow

working title. I like meadow, because it evokes the [[Digital garden\|Digital garden]] vibe. I would probably do something like "Strawberry fields", but maybe that can be a future project.

### vibe

It's so soft and warm like frolicking through a field of flowers, going strawberry picking on a sunny day, rolling down a grassy hill. The colours are calm, since I prefer calmer colour schemes.

### custom icons and stuff?

I can't decide if I want **berries** or **flowers**, so maybe I will choose BOTH.

### How will I make this GARDEN vibes

The base colour palette is warm greens, almost like matcha.

The window top bar is sky blue.

Accents are currently a red berry sort of colour. This would be modified by the accent.
