## Purpose

- Write about my faith as I am learning
- Coherently connect my faith with my interests
    - Help me communicate that in my daily life
- Consciously reduce the amount of Christianese I use
    - I want to communicate ideas about my faith in better ways to friends who might not have any biblical foundation
- Encourage other Christians who share my passions in Jesus-centred ways
- Maybe make a big reference of all the things I have learned from the Bible, personally
- Engage with culture in a thoughtful Christian way
- Share how God teaches me throughout my life
- Provide insight into my imperfect brain
- Not a bible study.
- Sort of unfiltered musings about things I find interesting

### What problem am I helping my readers solve?

- Academic angle

    “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.”

 Colossians 3:23-24 ESV

    [https://bible.com/bible/59/col.3.23-24.ESV](https://bible.com/bible/59/col.3.23-24.ESV)

    - Christian high school and uni students who want to find guidance about studying, productivity and Christian living from a Christian perspective

    - Holistic Christian guides to education

- Learning angle

## Niches

- Lifelong learning
- Productivity/organisation
- Study tips and habits
- Ethical/sustainable fashion

    - Adverse childhood experiences?
- Young adult/college
- University
- Christian living - honouring God
- Book reviews about the other things I’m interested in
- Movies, YouTube and TV
- Cultural engagement
- Minimalism? Intentional living
- Green living
- Low waste
- Language-learning
