I only slightly want to claw my eyes out. May I please just have pretty fonts?

Need to fix theme-vars.css with my actual desired fonts lol

## Best practices

- Line length tool <http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/add-line-break-by-length/>
- Typography <https://www.editorx.com/shaping-design/article/font-size>
- Functional text <https://pimpmytype.com/functional-text/>
