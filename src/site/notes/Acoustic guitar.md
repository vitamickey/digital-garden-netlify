## My electric-acoustic guitar

Takamine Black Dragon. Bought on FB Marketplace from a smoker for around $250. Has a pick-up powered by a 9V battery. I use the strap I got from [[Acoustic guitar#^a73913\|Acoustic guitar#^a73913]]. The action is high, despite me and [[People/Mark Hayman\|my stepdad]]'s best efforts to reduce it. 

## The church guitar

I wish it were mine. It is a Yamaha Thinline Acoustic APX600. It plays really nicely, is good for my small hands/build, and as a fun bonus runs on two AA batteries. I do not have it in my budget to buy a new guitar, but at this point I kind of need it because I can't just keep playing my Takamine sadly when I'm out and about. I want the Yamaha.

## My first guitar
{ #a73913}


Big fat dreadnought Fender. Gifted from [[People/Mark Hayman\|my stepdad]]. It was too big back in 2015 or 2016 when I received it. My hands were too small and the action was too high. So, I didn't start playing it until [[COVID\|COVID]] hit, being trapped inside and wanting to flex my musical muscles post-high school musical escapades.

## Pedals

A guy from my church recommends an acoustic pedal, just so you can add some life back into the sound. The straight acoustic sound can be pretty dry. Plus, it's nice to be able to inline mute and tune. Wishlist item.
