## Strings

Currently have Ernie Ball Power Slinky strings, put on by my stepdad whenever he did it last. Will try Ernie Ball Regular Slinky strings next.

Apparently no other brands are really worth it? Not sure. Need to investigate more.

Not sure how to replace electric guitar strings yet.

## Pedals

### Multi FX

Zoom G3Xn on recommendation from guys at my church. Bought secondhand from Cash Converters' online marketplace, who knew that was a thing. So far it's okay. Lots to play around with and sort of feeling around in the dark. So many options to dial it in, but I have no idea what exactly I should be doing with any of them in particular.
