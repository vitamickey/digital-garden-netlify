## My first guitar

Fender American Telecaster, Vintage White. '51 Nocaster-style pick-up, mod by my stepdad.

Given as a 21st birthday gift by [[people/Mark Hayman\|my stepdad]]. He is a guitar head.



### How I feel about it

I am obviously incredibly grateful to have been gifted a guitar. My problem is that I do not think the Tele Twang^TM is my long-term sound profile. I like more mellow/jazz tones.

Also, playing electric is hard. I think the electric police will come for my teeth soon if I don't learn [[How to use a pick\|How to use a pick]].

## Strings

Currently have Ernie Ball Power Slinky strings, put on by my stepdad whenever he did it last. Will try Ernie Ball Regular Slinky strings next.

Apparently no other brands are really worth it? Not sure. Need to investigate more.

Not sure how to replace electric guitar strings yet.

## Pedals

### Multi FX

Zoom G3Xn on recommendation from guys at my church. Bought secondhand from Cash Converters' online marketplace, who knew that was a thing. So far it's okay. Lots to play around with and sort of feeling around in the dark. So many options to dial it in, but I have no idea what exactly I should be doing with any of them in particular.
