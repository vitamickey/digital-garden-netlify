In a strange turn of events, a lot of the guys at my church recently downloaded BeReal, in order to be in the loop about people's lives without the baggage of other social media apps such as Instagram or Facebook.

I still dislike BeReal for reasons below, as well as having additional concerns:

- How does BeReal get funded? We are not far away from ads and corporations "being real" on BeReal
- You can now re-take your BeReals, which I feel defeats the entire purpose of the app. Sure, you can manufacture your first BeReal, which is just an inherent flaw with any camera-based thing, but being able to retake it?? Really? lol

A new [[Social media\|Social media]] platform where once a day at a random time you make a post as soon as you receive the notification app saying "it's time to post", or whatever the notification says. 

This is to give the illusion that you ought to "be real", as the name suggests. 

Most of the kids at my tutoring centre are using it (ages 13-18 in 2022). 

It makes me think of the experiments they did with animals, conditioning them to crave food with certain responses, [[Pavlov's Theory of Classical Conditining\|Pavlov's Theory of Classical Conditining]][^jen]. Or, similarly, the prank in The Office that Jim pulls on Dwight with the mints and the computer (?) noise.
