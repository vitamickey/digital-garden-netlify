A new [[Social media\|Social media]] platform where once a day at a random time you make a post as soon as you receive the notification app saying "it's time to post", or whatever the notification says. 

This is to give the illusion that you ought to "be real", as the name suggests. 

Most of the kids at my tutoring centre are using it (ages 13-18 in 2022). 

It makes me think of the experiments they did with animals, conditioning them to crave food with certain responses, [[Pavlov's Theory of Classical Conditining\|Pavlov's Theory of Classical Conditining]][^jen]. Or, similarly, the prank in The Office that Jim pulls on Dwight with the mints and the computer (?) noise.
