I had a massive crisis in the middle of my first year of uni. As I grew in my faith and left high school (which was pretty bad for me), I became disillusioned with the idea of studying. What is the point of me spending this time in uni, studying for a degree that isn't a theological degree? I could spend all day studying my Bible but instead I must study linear analysis? And Cry so much because of it? Why. 

But really, we are called to honour God wherever we are placed, and we are called to all corners of the Earth to do so. And one of those places happens to be at university. So, when I study, I do my best so that it honours God.
