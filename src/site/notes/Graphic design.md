I just want to be able to refer to graphic design resources quickly.
A lot from Kel Lauren??

## Fonts and typefaces

I am making a separate page for [[Fonts and typefaces\|Fonts and typefaces]] because it used to be here but I always tried to find it by looking for a "fonts" file so it needs its own note.

## Making stuff

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) tbh who hasn't used Canva at this point??
- [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) I mostly use Affinity Designer. This is a great single-purchase digital suite, kind of like poor man's Adobe Creative Cloud. Contains:
  - Affinity Designer
  - Affinity Publisher
  - Affinity Photo

## Stock stuff

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
  - good for reg photos
  - I have been using this for years
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
  - good for graphics
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
  - good for videos in particular
- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
  - kind of a weird one but like I have used it since primary school and so it feels OG
- [Public Domain Vectors](https://publicdomainvectors.org/)
