I did 200Â°C for 20min, flip, and then 10min. Canola oil and salt, on aluminium. Eggplant chunks surprisingly large going into the oven. Those bad boys SHRINK. Also, I put zucchini, which def needed to be smaller slices (lower moisture content?? but generally tougher flesh).

## Sweet potato and eggplant

sweet potato should be smaller maybe? nowhere near as brown as eggplant. 20 + 10min at 220C ish
