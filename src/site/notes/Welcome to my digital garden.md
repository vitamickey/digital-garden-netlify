Welcome to my lil' digital garden! This is a place where I would like to learn and grow.

Some places to start on this website would be my post about [[Digital garden\|digital gardens]] or my first post [[So it began\|So it began]] on why I made this website.

## Things you should know before trekking through this site

üåª **This is my living, breathing garden.** *These things I've learned, ideas, opinions, essays, etc., are open to change, and open to growth.* Hopefully this does show my change over time, but please keep in mind that some things will represent my thoughts currently, but if a note is particularly old, it may represent my thoughts from x years ago.

ü¶ã **Notes will be in various stages of growth.** Some notes will be super developed and long, others may be empty/single-sentence. I would like to adopt some kind of metaphor for growth on this website (like maybe cocoons into caterpillars into butterflies, since I have chosen the butterfly for my website motif), but we'll see.

‚úè **Notes here are primarily written for me** and not for general public consumption, so, it's likely that some things will not make sense. I like to make notes comprehensible enough for myself to understand, so hopefully that's not too much of an issue? Stuff to be written on my [personal website, michaelacheong.com](https://michaelacheong.com/) is more intended for an audience other than myself.

üìñ **This website will be a combination of a personal wiki and a digital garden.** Some notes will be titled as things, some will be ideas and declarative statements, some will be abstract titles (I think I have been inspired by [vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers) in that regard), and some will be none of those things. If I think too hard about maintaining consistency in my note titles then I will cease to write anything at all.
