When you have a foolproof system to track the things you need to do, your brain stops constantly reminding you, freeing you from stress and allowing you to better focus.

1. Write everything out
2. Make it actionable
    
    physical/visible
    
3. Park it where it belongs
4. Review frequently
5. Just do it
    
    rinse and repeat
