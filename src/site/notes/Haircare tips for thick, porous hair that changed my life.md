Blowdry your hair after washing it, but just at the roots if you're short on time. Moisture at the scalp is a breeding ground for bacteria. This also allows you to dry your hair in a way that is styled how you want it.

Do not pick your greys. This will only cause damage to your hair follicles.

Get laser hair removal. A light-medium complexion combined with black hair is the perfect combo, as the pigment difference helps the laser target the hairs as opposed to your skin. It's so cheap (at least in Australia): costs $15 per session. No regrets. Long-term it saves you time shaving and money on razors and creams. I only got underarm bc it's the only place I get very bothersome ingrown hairs if I shave. If I didn't reliably get ingrowns after shaving, I would not have gotten laser, as I am happy to shave so infrequently that the long-term cost barely adds up.
