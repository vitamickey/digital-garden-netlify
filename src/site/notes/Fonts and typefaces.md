OH BOYYY I can display my fave fonts here and their respective merits okay. I always use the word fonts where I should be saying typefaces, so I will use "typeface" as much as I can from here on out.

A typeface describes an overall style of letters, and fonts refer to the specific version of that letter style with different weights and sizes and such. The typeface (or type family) is like the family a font belongs to.

## This website and the other one too

- Times New Roman on both
    - HIGHLY COMPATIBLE
	    - Websafe
	    - Supports languages that I need/type in
	         - IPA (phonetic alphabet)
	         - Vietnamese
	         - French
	         - literally any alphabet I could possibly want
     -  I like the basic vibe ngl :) it adds a certain dated quality that makes me feel quirky
- [Avara](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/) using for title headers on my personal website, but I can't figure out how to get them to work for the [[Digital Garden overhaul with Obsidian Plugin\|Digital Garden website]].
- [Xanh Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Xanh+Mono) also on personal website bc it's made for vietnamese and I think it looks really nice. Only downfall is that its readability is pretty Bad.
  - Considering replacing this with [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) or [M PLUS Code Latin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/M+PLUS+Code+Latin)

### Showcase

### Pretty typefaces <3

- [Avara](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/) as prev. mentioned. A font that has no curves, only straight lines
- [Wremena](https://typefaces.temporarystate.net/preview/Wremena) it's just vibey
- [Junicode Bold Condensed](https://open-foundry.com/fonts/junicode_bold_condensed) it gives Newspaper.
- [Basteleur](https://www.velvetyne.fr/fonts/basteleur/) modern but medieval

### Cool typefaces

- [Cantique](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/cantique/) Viet support with a Greek letter twist
- [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) very cool... Viet support. But I got a bit sick of it, I think it's too *fun* for me.
- [https://rosettatype.com/Handjet](https://rosettatype.com/Handjet) a variable font that animates letters using a grid of repeated elements

### Typefaces with a story in my life

- Britannic Bold (in primary school, I said this was my fave font LOL but that's not the case now)
- Lora (used for my old studyblr HAHA)
- Comic Sans (used to write a series of scathing anonymous notes during high school that I was accused of writing. Maybe I will write about that one day, that wasn't the best time)

### Other typefaces with a story

- [Occlusion Grotesque](https://bjoernkarmann.dk/project/occlution_grotesque), a typeface being made by a tree.
- [22/22](https://2222.seabellfoundry.com/), a collection of 22 fonts being released once at a time for free throughout end of 2022, or donate and receive all fonts released at time of donation.
