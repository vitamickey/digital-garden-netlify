I use a bullet journal. Yes, I got into the craze when I was in Year 9 at school and studyblr was taking the internet by storm. It was quite the time.

My first iterations of bujoing I recall being kinda ugly ngl.

Now, I follow the Ryder Caroll method, and not the pretty artsy method. Not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact, I loved doing that for many years, and it really helped ground me through some pretty dark and dire times.
