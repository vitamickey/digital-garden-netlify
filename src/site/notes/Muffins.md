I tried these banana muffins on a [sheet pan/baking tray](https://slate.com/culture/2017/11/bake-muffins-pancakes-or-brownies-in-a-sheet-pan.html). Kinda fun, except they were a little chewy in that format. Maybe a smaller cake pan would suffice. I didn't have muffin tins at my place when baking.

This is a nice recipe but messed it up the first time I did it.
