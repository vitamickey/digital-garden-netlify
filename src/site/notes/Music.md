I like music!

## Making music

### Instruments I've played and thus have skills in

- Voice (always)

    Okay I know this kind of doesn't count but I am primarily a singer so

- [[Acoustic guitar\|Acoustic guitar]] (2016? - Present)
- [[Electric guitar\|Electric guitar]] (2023 - Present)
- Bassoon (2015 - 2019)
- Clarinet (2013 - 2017??)
- [[Piano\|Piano]] (2007? - 2016 but with a break in the middle idk, 2023 - Present)
- Recorder lol
- Ukulele sort of whenever a friend of mine has a ukulele for me to mess around with

### Also MuseScore

I have developed a strange obsession with [[MuseScore\|MuseScore]] and making arrangements of songs for either use in our current band, [[Skill Issue\|Skill Issue]], or for playing at church for [[Music ministry\|Music ministry]].

## Made music, i.e. Pieces I've played or sung

#### Primary school

I don't remember THAT much of what I played in primary school. It was a while ago and I didn't actually write down any of this stuff when I was younger
