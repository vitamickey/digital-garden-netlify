  - Cyclothymic disorder
    - less severe, still impacts daily function
  - Substance-induced bipolar disorder
- Causes
  - Here it will be made clear why I have an irrational fear about developing bipolar disorder.
  - Genetics
    - 1 parent with bipolar -> 1 in 10 chance of child
      - [[People/Brian Cheong\|someone I know]] has bipolar disorder (I., I think)
      - [[People/Frances Cheong\|another person I know]] had bipolar disorder (definitely I., it was quite severe)
    - 2 parents -> 4 in 10
  - Chemical imbalances
  - Triggers
    - HEEHHEHEE yeah this is another place that worries me
      - I have a pretty bad combo of risk factors
        - [[People/Linh Hayman\|someone else I know]] is prob clinically depressed
        - my ACE score is pretty high/I had a traumatic childhood
        - family conflict is high
        - constant resurfacing of trauma and hardship in my life, it seems
        - general anxiety can be quite high
          - anxiety attacks do occur but they're not too common and they're not really panic attacks
    - 'Women who are predisposed to bipolar disorder may experience their first episode while they are pregnant or after they have their baby.'
      - my JAW DROPPED when I read this
- Treatment
  - Initial
    - medications, individualised
  - Ongoing
    - with the aim of preventing relapse and improving quality of life
    - medications
      - antidepressants (short period, only should be combined with bipolar-specific mood stablisers)
      - lithium, [[People/Brian Cheong\|Dad]] takes this and so did [[People/Frances Cheong\|Dad's mum]]
      - anticonvulsants
      - antipsychotics, in particular [[Risperidone\|Risperidone]] sticks out bc [[People/Linh Hayman\|Mum]] has taken it...
  - Therapy
- Prevention
  - no guarantee (yay)
  - be aware of early warning signs
    - inform friends and family
  - avoid substances
    - incl [[Caffeine\|Caffeine]] (luckily I don't drink coffee, take that [[People/Joah Nelson\|Joah]] and other coffee enthusiasts in my life)
  - stress management
  - sleep
- Complications
  - can become more severe without treatment
  - high risk of other health issues
