I picked up piano either last year or the end of 2022 when I moved out and brought the electric piano from [[21 Kelceda St\|home]] to [[6 Merchiston St\|my place]]. 

This was partially out of a desire to pick the skill back up but mostly due to a growing concern that I was losing the inability to read sheet music. Alas, my fears have been mostly assuaged, as I now engage with different forms and mediums of sheet music. All is well. I also have developed a mild obsession with [[MuseScore\|MuseScore]], which has helped maintain my ability to read music.
